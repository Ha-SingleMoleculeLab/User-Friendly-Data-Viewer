# User-Friendly-Data-Viewer

After .PMA files are analyzed by the IDL scripts, .PKS files and .TRACES files are generated. Although these files contain all the necessary information (the position of fluorescent molecules, the donor and the acceptor intensity of each molecule at each frame), a tool that reads and shows them in user-friendly format is required. 

As the “tool”, MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) is chosen, and this manual documents two MATLAB scripts written for smFRET data analysis. Eventually, people would write more and more scripts to do the analysis that they want, but these two scripts will remain the most useful and frequently used ones.

This manual is written using MATLAB R2008a, but MATLAB 5 and higher versions work well with the two scripts introduced here.
